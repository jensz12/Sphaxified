Sphaxified
==========

A central repository for Sphaxified textures.

These are technically copyright their respective owners, but released freely because it's nice and helpful to do so.

These textures are not restricted by the main BDcraft [License](http://bdcraft.net/license-terms-of-use).

Lots of PSDs for textures can be found in the main [BDcracft Patches](https://github.com/BDcraft-Patches) organization repositories.
